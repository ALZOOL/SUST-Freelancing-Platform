SUST Freelancing Platform It is a platform for students of the College of Computer Science and Information Technology to address the problem of lack of practice and experience among students, and it also works to reduce the gap between students and the labor market, by providing appropriate exercises and making simulations that resemble the work environment so that the student gains the greatest amount of experience from it.
The main goal of the platform is to improve the student's level in the practical aspect by providing several exercises divided into graded levels according to the student's level. The platform is managed by professors at the university, and there is a special system for clients who offer their work to the university to be implemented by students who are at the highest levels in order, so that they are qualified to work on clients' projects.

Created and developed with PHP Lravael & Vue.js & javascript.
